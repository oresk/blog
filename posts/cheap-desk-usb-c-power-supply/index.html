<p>Cheap desk usb-c power supply, or the beauty of 3D printing. About seven years ago I bought Crealities Ender 3. About a year and a half ago I replaced it with an Ender 5S1 which I later modified to a corexy with the Mercury One.1 project, but that is a theme for a different blog post. I took the ender 3 apart to reuse the parts where I can. One of the valuable components you can take out of 3d printers is the power supply. I have created a 240W usbc bench power supply with it.
I used a <a href="">pcb board</a> from aliexpress.

<p>Up until now I used OpenSCAD for my simple 3d modeling. With the recent release of the 1.0 version by the nice people of FreeCAD, I have decided is the time to learn how to use it. I think I came up with a good design as I reused the power supply fan to blow over the inductors and the mosfets. One thing that I did not know, but that ended up being a great feature is that the power supply modulates the fan rpm.

I iterated a couple of times and got to a functional model that is good enough for me. All stls are available on my <a href="">printables profile</a>. One thing to add is that I reduced the power supply output voltage to a bit more than 21V from the 24V. That should make it a bit easier for the pcb at 20V output.

<p>So, with a bit of time and a bit of plastic I saved the power supply from trash and created a useful and usable bench usbc power supply for myself.</p>
