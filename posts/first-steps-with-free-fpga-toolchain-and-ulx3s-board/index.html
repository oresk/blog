  <h1>First steps with free FPGA toolchain and ULX3S board</h1>

  <p>So, this blog post first needs a bit of a background before jumping intro the technical parts (actually I am also writing before I&rsquo;ve done anything with the ULX3S board). I have some experience with FPGAs, even my XXXZavrsni rad was an arbitrary function generator made in a xilinx spartan fpga with a microblaze soft core and a serial peripheral, decomposition of functions was done in a Matlab program.</p>
<p>But the thing is that was a really long time ago, about 6-7 years ago. And not to sound like an old fart, but it was a really different game back than. There was no way of running the tools in Linux. Tools were around ~20gb at least, which is a lot even today but then it was really a lot. The simulator that came with the tools was poor so you needed to use ModelSim tools for simulations. Installing the tools needed a few magic incantations so it was a pain just to get to writing VHDL.</p>
<p>A couple if years ago I saw a cool <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7139-a_free_and_open_source_verilog-to-bitstream_flow_for_ice40_fpgas">presentation</a> about a FOSS toolchain for ice40 FPGAs. I haven&rsquo;t even tried it then, I did not have a ice40 board, did not know verilog and too be honest I thought that writing a FOSS toolchain for FPGAs, especially with the amount of info that was not available from the manufacturers. But I kept following what is happening.</p>
<p>What I got from the presentations XXXX linkovi XXXX from this year&rsquo;s CCC I thing they have proved me wrong. There are multiple routers, multiple supported FPGAs from different manufacturers and has been used now for pretty big projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to get a ULX3S board to test how the whole thing is actually working.</p>
<p>I am going to try to document as much as I can, the technical part and my thoughts during the whole exploration.</p>
<p>So, the first thing I did was to checkout the links inside RadionaOrg <a href="https://github.com/RadionaOrg/ulx3s-links">repo</a>. I&rsquo;ve found a blinky there so I started from there.</p>
<p>Considering the environment I did two things. First thing is I started doing everything not on my laptop but on the computer beneath my TV that is more beefy. The second thing is I</p>
